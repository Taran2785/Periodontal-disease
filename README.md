Prevalence of Severe Periodontal Disease Project
Project Overview
This project analyzes the prevalence of severe periodontal disease across various countries and continents. The primary objective is to explore patterns in the data, make predictions about future trends, and potentially develop a machine learning model to predict the prevalence based on features like country, continent, and population. Additionally, the project explores clustering countries based on similar prevalence values.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

Indicator: Description of the health indicator (e.g., Prevalence of severe periodontal disease).
Continent: The continent where the country is located.
Country: Name of the country.
Year: The year the data was recorded.
FactValueNumeric: The prevalence value of severe periodontal disease as a numeric value.
Value: Another numeric value representing a different aspect (e.g., an estimate or adjusted value).
DateModified: The date the data was last modified.
Difference: The difference between the two numeric values for each entry.
Project Objectives
Data Exploration:

Analyze and visualize trends in the prevalence of severe periodontal disease across different countries and continents.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values, and ensure data consistency.
Visualization:

Create visualizations to understand how prevalence varies across countries, continents, and over time.
Visualizations
Bar Plots: To show the prevalence of severe periodontal disease in different countries.
Scatter Plots: To visualize the relationship between population and prevalence.
Correlation Heatmap: To examine relationships between multiple variables.
Conclusion
This project aims to provide insights into the global prevalence of severe periodontal disease and its relationships with various factors such as country, continent, and population. The machine learning models developed in this project can help make predictions and guide public health initiatives to improve dental health on a global scale.
